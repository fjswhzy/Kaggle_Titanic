# Kaggle_Titanic

Hi everyone!

This is Zhiyong from Beijing China. I'm a young data scientist by the way.

Github is a wonderful way to learn skills of data mining following other data scientists.

This repository is built for Titanic Prediction Task in Kaggle. Welcome any advice from anyone!

Thank for your sharing!
